## Principle of Universal Design

- Equitable Use: This program is useful for all of those who are on campus as it allows people to rate any location in University of Toronto. For example, the location a person wants to rate could be a quiet spot to study at, a fun place to party at, or a good food truck to eat at.
- Flexible Use: In the map view for a location, a zoom function is implemented. This enables people who live on-campus to see the exact location and lets people who live far away estimate how far it is from their home.
- Simple and Intuitive Use: For cleanliness and readability, the pages are designed for one purpose each (e.g. location on map, list of reviews). Text boxes and buttons are also labeled clearly so anyone can understand how to navigate through the pages. 
- Perceptible Information: When creating a review, there will be a visual cue to the rating a user gives where the given rating is shown by a number of stars. Another possible perceptible information feature we can add in the future is adding text to speech for those who are visually impaired.
- Tolerance for Error: Some methods of tolerance for error that can be added in the future are adding a function for users to edit their reviews in case they change their mind or make a typo. Another method could be adding a confirm review button when creating a review so users could prevent a mistake beforehand.
- Low Physical Effort: The map allows users to zoom by scrolling which reduces the need to move the mouse to press the plus and minus signs. Also, the create review page allows users to rate by clicking the stars which reduces the need to type in a numerical rating.
- Appropriate Size and Space: We have made most of the UIâ€™s take up the whole window which allows for a better view. In the future, we can also add a text size function which lets users modify the size of texts and buttons for their own preference.


## Marketing Target

We would primarily market our program towards University Students. The main purpose of our application is for students to rate different spots on campus for other students to see. Students can rate locations such as food trucks, eating spots, and libraries. We hope that students use our application as a resource guide when trying to find different spots on campus. 


## Less Used Demographics
Unfortunately, even though we have designed this project with the goal of making it accessible to a wide group of people, those whose impairments affect their travel are less likely to use our program. This is due to the fact that not being able to travel around normally could cause them to not have access to the physical locations even if they are able to access the reviews for said locations.
